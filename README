Why Open Interest Matters
In traditional futures markets, traders closely monitor changes in open interest as an indicator to determine market sentiment and the strength behind price trends. 

Open interest indicates capital flowing in and out of the market. As capital flows into a futures contract, open interest increases. Conversely,  as capital flows out of the derivatives markets, open interest declines. For this reason, increasing open interest is often considered as one of the many factors that can serve as confirmation of a bull market, whereas decreasing open interest signals a bear market.

Traders usually track the changes in price, volume, and open interest to analyze the prevailing market sentiment. Table 2 shows an interpretation of market behavior as a result of these fluctuations.

Open interest is an important signal of market behavior and may provide clues to market direction. Traders often incorporate these factors into their analysis of price trends and momentum.
